### Valero *et al*. 2014. Evaluating the impacts of fixing or estimating growth parameters, across life histories and data vailability.


### Summary
Simulations with `ss3sim` to guide users when it is best to estimate growth within SS compared to using external estimates.

### Abstract
Monte Carlo simulations were used to determine when it is better to estimate growth internally in a stock assessment model compared to using external estimates. Simulations were ran for a variety of data combinations as well as multiple life-history types.

### Todo:
* Change bounds of col model
* Change A1 to a different number so that A and L cases align
* Run models with flatfish
* Create rockfish models
