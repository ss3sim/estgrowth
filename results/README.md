## Convergence
Convergence was an issue for those scenarios that did not have age composition
data. Particularly when fishing exhibited a two-way trip rather than a constant
pattern. Approximately 70\% of the runs did not converge when no age data were
present and convergence only increased to 50\% when length data were available
from both the fishery and the survey but still no age data were present.

## No age data
The lack of age composition data was less of an issue for the longer lived species
(yelloweye) than species with shorter life histories. Although, estimates of
*CV~old~* were equally biased and imprecise for both the long- and medium-lived
life histories.
